# Question 6: Portfolio Construction
In this question we construct a global balanced index fund portfolio using a mix of traded global indices that we load below. From the question I can already gain a clear understanding of the type of optimiser that will be preferred from a subjective perspective. What I mean by this is that The constraints are structured in a way that suggest a more moderate wealth preserving type portfolio need be constructed.As I've spent some time trying to build optimisers by hand in preparation for this question I've come across a helpful package but I feel does the best job of allowing for very flexible constraints.For this reason I load the data in and open the portfolio analytics package. Before integrating it straight in I clean the data as normal.
```{r}
Q6MAA <- read_rds("data/MAA.rds")
Q6msci <- read_rds("data/msci.rds") %>%
  filter(Name %in% c("MSCI_ACWI", "MSCI_USA", "MSCI_RE", "MSCI_Jap"))
```
For easeability in the constraints section of the optimisation procedure I've proceeded to rename the indices so that the object orientated group-by constraints are easily carried out.
```{r}
Q6MAAwide <- Q6MAA %>% select(date, Ticker, Price) %>% spread(Ticker, Price)
Q6msciwide <- Q6msci %>% spread(Name, Price) 

Q6totalrtn <- Q6MAAwide %>% left_join(Q6msciwide, by = c("date")) %>% rename(
     "Asian_Currency" = `ADXY Index` ,
    "US_Currency" = `DXY Index` ,
    "Global_Bond1" = `LGAGTRUH Index`,
     "US_Bond1" = `LUAGTRUU Index`,
    "Euro_Bond1" = `LEATTREU Index`,
    "Global_Bond2" = `LGCPTRUH Index`,
    "US_Bond2" = `LUACTRUU Index`,
    "Euro_Bond2" = `LP05TREH Index`,
    "Commodity" = `BCOMTR Index`,
    "Japan_Equity" = `MSCI_Jap`,
    "US_Property" = `MSCI_RE`,
    "US_Equity" = `MSCI_USA`,
    "Global Equity" = `MSCI_ACWI`
)
 
Q6totalrtn2  <- Q6totalrtn %>%  gather(Tickers, Price, -date) %>%
    group_by(Tickers) %>%  filter(date > as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>% arrange(date) %>%  
    group_by(Tickers) %>%  mutate(dlogret = log(Price) - log(lag(Price))) %>% mutate(scaledret = (dlogret -  mean(dlogret, na.rm = T))) %>% filter(date > dplyr::first(date)) %>% 
    ungroup() 

Q6totalrtn3 <- Q6totalrtn2 %>% select(date, Tickers, dlogret) %>% 
    spread(Tickers, dlogret)
```
I will once more emphasise that the mean variance optimiser as well as other packages such as CVXR are quite tricky in terms of flexible constraints. Whilst I will give this optimisation procedure various objectives the main objective will be a wolf preserving risk adjusted return objective.

I then convert the data into a timeseries and load in the packages and plugins.
```{r}
Q6rtn <- Q6totalrtn3 %>% tbl_xts()

library(ROI)
library(ROI.plugin.quadprog)
library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(PortfolioAnalytics)
```

Below I specify the portfolio that will take on the constraint arguments there after the specific constraints that I specify are as follows: Full investment must take place and long only positions are added. And objective is then added to minimise portfolio standard deviation as an initial starting point in this optimiser but will be changed later on.The optimisation procedure is then initiated and the return on investment method is specified.
```{r}

port_spec <- portfolio.spec(colnames(Q6rtn))
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio =port_spec, type = "full_investment")
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "long_only")
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "risk", name = "StdDev")
opt <- optimize.portfolio(Q6rtn, portfolio = port_spec, optimize_method = "ROI")
print(opt)
extractWeights(opt)
chart.Weights(opt)
```
As mentioned we explore the most simple case above and we print out the results in terms of weights it now becomes clear why the names were changed.

```{r}
print(port_spec)
```
V last three constraints are then implemented below into a more complex optimiser as follows: A box constraint is implemented when no single asset may constitute more than 40% of the portfolio, And following this to group constraints are initialised for equity and bond instruments where equity cannot collectively constitute more than 60% and bonds can't constitute more than 25%.


```{r}
port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "weight_sum", min_sum = 1, max_sum = 1)

port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "box", min = 0, max = 0.4)

port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "group", groups = list(c(3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10)), group_min = 0, group_max = 0.25)

port_spec <- add.constraint(portfolio = port_spec, type = "group", groups = list(c(5, 8, 12)), group_min = 0, group_max = 0.6)

print(port_spec)
```
Following this the objectives and constraints are once again specified.
```{r}
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "return", name = "mean")

# Added a risk objective to minimize portfolio standard deviation
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "risk", name = "StdDev")

# Add a risk budget objective
port_spec <- add.objective(portfolio = port_spec, type = "risk_budget", name = "StdDev", min_prisk = 0.05, max_prisk = 0.1)

print(port_spec)
```
With the risk budget and the minimised portfolio standard deviation objective added we now run a single parent optimisation first.

```{r}
rp <- random_portfolios(portfolio=port_spec, permutations = 50, rp_method ='simplex')
opt <- optimize.portfolio(R = Q6rtn, portfolio = port_spec, optimize_method = "random", rp = rp, trace = TRUE)
print(opt)
chart.Weights(opt)
```
With this initial waiting procedure estimated we now run a periodic rebalancing optimisation using the 60 day rolling window and quarterly re-balancing.
```{r}
opt_rebal <- optimize.portfolio.rebalancing(R = Q6rtn, portfolio = port_spec, optimize_method = "random", rp = rp, trace = TRUE, search_size = 1000, rebalance_on = "quarters", training_period = 60, rolling_window = 60)
print(opt_rebal)
extractObjectiveMeasures(opt)
```
Above we observe that rebalance states are also given within the portfolio.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(extractObjectiveMeasures(opt_rebal))
```
```{r}
extractWeights(opt)
chart.Weights(opt)
```
With the optimal rebalance procedure undertaken the weights are then given where after they are charted as seen above. This is then compared to the optimal chart wait to observe the difference between the in and out of sample fit.
```{r}
chart.Weights(opt_rebal)
```
Lastly from our econometric background it is clear that not all assets display the same amount of contribution towards risk for this reason we plug the risk contribution and observe that global equity US bonds and US property display the highest Degrees of risks. 
```{r}
chart.RiskBudget(opt_rebal, match.col = "StdDev", risk.type = "percentage")
```
We conclude with a mention of the initial objective which was a wealthy preserving optimiser given the type of constraints for this reason we see a very modest return but very well risk adjusted.
