    In this question a brief Analysis is conducted to determine what current yield spreads in mid to longer dated bonds have returned in the last decade. A clear step why is increase is observed at the beginning of the global pandemic.

# Question 1: Yield Spread.

Since the beginning of 2020 the current Yield spreads in local mid-to-longer dated bond yields have been the highest in decades. This is conventionally expressed as the difference in these yields of these instruments in percentage points or basis points.

To investigate this I will conduct a brief analysis on what is the driving is healed spreads.
I begin by initialising my data:
```{r, include= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
SA_bonds <- read_rds("data/SA_Bonds.rds")
#BE_Infl <- read_rds("data/BE_Infl.rds")
#bonds_2y <- read_rds("data/bonds_2y.rds")
#bonds_10y <- read_rds("data/bonds_10y.rds")
#usdzar <- read_rds("data/usdzar.rds")
#ZA_Infl <- read_rds("data/ZA_Infl.rds")
#IV <- read_rds("data/IV.rds")

```
Here I gather the data and plot the three South African bond yields. Here are the yields are plotted against time And it is clear that other than a few notable periods such as crashes of 2001 to 2003, And the financial crisis, There is a consistent pattern where the longer term bonds yields slightly higher but all three follow similar trajectories. What is becoming noticeable now in most return series is in a similar manner to the financial crisis various patterns are observed from the beginning of the Covid pandemic.  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tbl2xts)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)

bond_Adj <- 
SA_bonds %>% gather(Bond, Yield, -date) %>% arrange(date) 

bondplot1 <- bond_Adj %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Yield, color = Bond), alpha = 0.8, 
    size = 1.2)

bondplot1 <- bondplot1 + fmxdat::theme_fmx() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "date", 
    y = "Yield", title = "Yield of ZAR Bonds.", subtitle = "Using 3 Month, 2 Year and 10 year bond yields.", caption = "Note:\nNico Katzke's data used")

print(bondplot1)

```
I notice several places where rates stagnate and thus check for missing values in the data.
```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
is.na(bond_Adj)
sum(is.na(bond_Adj))
```
It appears that all the data is present, with this I conduct further analysis of the actual spreads between the various bonds.

At first glance an immediate divergence can be observed between the three bond yields, specifically with the three-month and two-year yields diverging from the longer 10 year bond yield. Before investigating this from an economic and qualitative perspective further, it is worth investigating it more formally.
```{r}
bond_Adj_yield <- SA_bonds %>%
    arrange(date) %>% 
mutate("10Yr2Yr_spread" = ZA_10Yr - ZA_2Yr,"10Yr3M_spread" = ZA_10Yr - SA_3M,"2Yr3M_spread" = ZA_2Yr - SA_3M ) %>% select(date, "10Yr3M_spread","10Yr2Yr_spread","2Yr3M_spread" )

bond_Adj_yield_tdy <- bond_Adj_yield %>% gather(bondpair, Spread , -date) %>% arrange(date) 

bondplot2 <- bond_Adj_yield_tdy %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Spread, color = bondpair), alpha = 0.8, size = 1.2) 

bondplot2 <- bondplot2 + fmxdat::theme_fmx() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "date", 
    y = "Yield Spread", title = "Yield Spread of ZAR Bonds.", subtitle = "Using 3 Month, 2 Year and 10 year bond yields.", caption = "Note:\nNico Katzke's data used")

print(bondplot2)
```
Here the data has been groups in three prepares where the difference is taken between the longer maturity bond from within the pair. As mentioned earlier there are various periods where the yields exhibit Volatile behaviour. Consistent with the two periods mentioned earlier, negative or inverted yields are observed from 2001 to 2004 and again from 2006 to 2009. This will be addressed again later but is worth noting in terms of the behaviour of participants in the market. To get a better understanding of addressing the question at hand I subsets the data to address only the previous decade.
```{r}
bond_Adj_yield_tdy2010 <- bond_Adj_yield %>% gather(bondpair, Spread , -date) %>% arrange(date) %>% 
    filter(date > "2010-01-01")

bondplot3 <- bond_Adj_yield_tdy2010 %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = Spread, color = bondpair), alpha = 0.8, size = 1.2) 

bondplot3 <- bondplot3 + fmxdat::theme_fmx() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "date", 
    y = "Yield Spread", title = "Yield Spread of ZAR Bonds in the last dacade.", subtitle = "Using 3 Month, 2 Year and 10 year bond yields.", caption = "Note:\nNico Katzke's data used")

print(bondplot3)
```
It is clear from the above Graaf that's-year-old spreads were quite stable up and till the beginning of the pandemic and a significant level increase is observed for all three assets.
